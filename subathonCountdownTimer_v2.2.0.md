---

#### Subathon Configuration and Start

Most of the configuration for the timer will be done in the action `Subathon 1. Configuration and Start`. Running this action will start the Subathon timer with the configured settings.

| Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Countdown Timer Settings** |   |   |
| `initialSubathonDuration` | Set to how long you want to start your stream | `3h` |
| `subathonMaxDuration` | Set to how long you want the limit of your subathon to be | `2d` |
| **Twitch Hype Train / Happy Hour Settings** | Multiply time added while a Twitch Hype Train or a designated Happy Hour event is live |   |
| `subathonHypeTrainName` | Customize the name of your Hype Train/Happy Hour | `Twitch Hype Train` |
| `subathonHypeTrainMultiplier` | Options:<br>`#` - Use a number for a constant multiplier<br>`linear` - Grows at constant rate, 0.1 per level<br>`exponential` - Starts slow, then accelerates rapidly<br>`sigmoidal` - Starts slow, accelerates, then levels off (faster growth than exponential)  | `2` |
| `subathonHypeTrainLevelUpIncrement` | If using a Twitch Hype Train triggers and the `linear` multiplier type, user a number to increment the multiplier. It will increment each level up until you reach `subathonHypeTrainMaxMultiplier` | `0.2` |
| `subathonHypeTrainMaxMultiplier` | This is the max value the multiplier can be incremented to. Used only for multipliers that increment based on Hype Train Level | `10` |
| **OBS Settings** |   |   |
| `subathonObsConnection` | Set to the zero-indexed connection number found in `Stream Apps > OBS` | `0` |
| `subathonScene` | Set to the name of your nested ncene that will house the text source for the timer | `[NS] SubathonTimer` |
| `subathonSource` | Set to the name of your text source that will display the countdown timer | `[TS] SubathonCounter` |
| `subathonDisplayDays` | Set whether or not you want to display days in the OBS countdown timer.<br>Example:<br>True: `5.04:03:02`<br>False: `124:03:02` | `True` |
| **Chat Message Settings** |   |   |
| `subathonSendMessageTo` | Set to platforms you wish to send to. Any combination of twitch, youtube, trovo, all separated by commas with no spaces | `twitch,youtube,trovo` |
| `subathonSendAllPlatforms` | When sending messages, send to all platforms, or just the triggering platform (from a command) | `True` |
| `subathonSendAsBot` | Set to true if you want to use your bot account to send messages. False, otherwise | `True` |

### Add Time configuration for monetary triggers

The Action Group `Subathon Countdown Timer Add Time` will have actions you can configure for adding time to the timer based on the trigger.

For any monetary triggers, you can configure `%moneyDivide%` and `%timeToAdd%`. The easiest way to think about it is: for each `%moneyDivide%`, add `%timeToAdd%`. Example: For each $2.50 tipped, add 60s. A $5 tip would add 120s, or two minutes.

### Add Time configuration for Twitch Subscription triggers

You can configure how much time to add for the different tiers of Twitch Subscriptions using these actions:

- Subathon Twitch Sub Tier 1 Config
- Subathon Twitch Sub Tier 2 Config
- Subathon Twitch Sub Tier 3 Config

<img src="./assets/addTimeTwitchSub.png" width=75% height=75%>

### Event Configuration

You can configure *most* messages sent by the subathon timer via Set Arguments in the according actions. You will be able to use the following arguments to customize how much time has been added/remaining/elapsed

- Most actions will be able to have a customized chat message
- Each action will show which arguments are available
- The following arguments are available with all actions that have message customization available:

| Argument Name | Format |
| --- | --- |
| `%countdownElapsedLong%` | `x days, x hours, x minutes, and x seconds` |
| `%countdownElapsedShort%` | `0.00:00:00` |
| `%countdownRemainingLong%` | `x days, x hours, x minutes, and x seconds` |
| `%countdownRemainingShort%` | `0.00:00:00` |
| `%maxDurationLong%` | `x days, x hours, x minutes, and x seconds` |
| `%maxDurationShort%` | `0.00:00:00` |

Messages can then be sent to all configured platforms by setting argument %message%, then Execute C# Method `SendMessageToChat`.

#### Available Custom Events

- `Subathon Event Cancelled` - Triggers when cancelling the subathon using command `!subathoncancel` twice in a row
- `Subathon Event Completed` - Triggers when timer hits zero
- `Subathon Event Paused` - Triggers when the timer is paused
- `Subathon Event Resumed` - Triggers when the timer is resumed
- `Subathon Event Started`- Triggers when timer is started for the first time
- `Subathon Event Time Added` - Triggers when time is added
- `Subathon Event Time Added Limit Reached` - Triggers when the limit is reached for adding time

### OBS Configuration

#### Creating the Scene and GDI Text Source

NOTE: Don't forget to make sure OBS is connected in the `Stream Apps` tab!

1. Create a scene and name it what you named it in the Streamer.bot action. `[NS] SubathonTimer` by default (NS is short for nested scene)
2. In that newly created scene, create a GDI text source with what you named it in the Streamer.bot action. `[TS] SubathonCounter` by default (TS is short for text source)

- Feel free to format the font, style, and transform however you like. For best looking results, use a mono-space font and align to the right
- When the timer is running, it will automatically update the text source with the time left in the subathon
- You may add this nested scene into any other scenes as a source. For more information on nested scenes, watch this video: [Nutty explains OBS Nested Scenes - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RdmaEjuknQ&t=99s)

## Usage

### Starting Subathon

Configure action `Subathon 1. Configuration and Start`, then trigger this action.

The Action Group `Subathon Countdown Timer Add Time` is enabled when the timer is running. Time can now be added while the timer is running.

### Pausing/Resuming

You have the ability to pause your Subathon and resume at a later time.

The Action Group `Subathon Countdown Timer Add Time` is disabled when the timer is paused.

By default, pausing the Subathon also pauses the ability to add time! If you wish for time to be added while the timer is paused, make sure to disable the action `Subathon Event Action Group Disable`
